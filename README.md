Description:
This repository is for deploying Ethereum smart contracts using Truffle framework. It includes the necessary contracts, migration scripts, test files, and deployment scripts.

Explanation of Repository Structure:

contracts/: This directory contains the Solidity smart contract files. In this example, it includes two contracts: HelloWorld.sol and Token.sol.

migrations/: This directory contains the migration scripts used by Truffle to deploy the smart contracts. The filenames typically start with a number to specify the deployment order. In this example, it includes two migration scripts: 1_initial_migration.js and 2_deploy_contracts.js.

test/: This directory contains the test files for the smart contracts. It is recommended to write unit tests to ensure the contracts work as expected. In this example, it includes two test files: helloWorld.js and token.js.

scripts/: This directory contains additional scripts related to contract deployment. It may include utility scripts or custom deployment scripts. In this example, it includes deploy.js for deploying the contracts and utils.js for utility functions.

.gitignore: This file specifies which files or directories should be ignored by Git. It helps exclude unnecessary files from being tracked, such as build artifacts or configuration files.

LICENSE: This file contains the license under which the project is distributed. You can choose an appropriate license for your project or use the default MIT License.

README.md: This file provides information about the project, its purpose, usage, and any other relevant details.

truffle-config.js: This file is the configuration file for Truffle framework. It includes settings for network connections, compilers, and other Truffle-specific configurations.
